/**
 * SQLite has no event-based CDC for external writers.
 *
 * `sqlite3_update_hook` only fires for writes made through the *same in-process
 * connection handle*. Data Bridge opens a database file that a *different*
 * process writes to, so it can never see those writes via the hook, and there's
 * no public WAL-tailing API that yields logical row changes. so we report
 * `supported: false` and steer the user to the polling (watch) trigger, which
 * works fine for SQLite.
