/**
 * CDC provider abstraction.
 *
 * every engine captures changes a different way (Postgres logical replication,
 * MySQL binlog, MongoDB change streams, Redis keyspace notifications) but they
 * all feed the SAME downstream pipeline: render the row, deliver it over HTTP,
 * record the delivery, persist a resume cursor.
 *
 * a `CdcProvider` hides the engine-specific "how do I get a stream of changes"
 * behind a small interface. {@link HookCdcService} is the engine-agnostic
 * orchestrator: picks a provider, owns the run lifecycle, and runs the shared
 * per-change handler (dedupe, render, send, record, persist cursor). providers
 * never touch the metadata store or the delivery service, they only emit
 * normalized {@link CdcChange}s.
